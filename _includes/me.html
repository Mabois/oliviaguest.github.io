  <img src="//avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5082092?v=3&amp;s=460"> Hi, I am a cognitive computational neuroscientist currently carrying out <a href="http://bradlove.org/lab#postdocs">postdoctoral research</a> with <a href="//bradlove.org/">Prof. Bradley C. Love</a> in the <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/olivia-guest/">Department of Experimental Psychology</a>, <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/profiles/research-staff/olivia-guest">Division of Psychology and Language Sciences</a>,
  <a href="//iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=OGUES12">University College London</a>.

<p>
  My undergraduate degree was in <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/ug-courses/bsc-cs/">Computer Science</a> at the University of York. After that, I moved on to an <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/study/masters/TMSPSYSCDS01">MSc in Cognitive and Decision Sciences</a> at UCL. I then undertook a <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/psychology/">PhD in Psychology</a> at Birkbeck on computational models for semantic memory.

<p>
  My current research primarily involves the creation and evaluation of computational accounts for categorisation and conceptual representation. I am focusing on what deep and shallow artificial neural networks can contribute to our understanding of categorisation
  in healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models.
